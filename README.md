Hi! I'm Stanley Goodwin.
I'm a Physics student at Rochester Institute of Technology with a focus in Computational & Theoretical Physics.
I work with physical simulations and lower-level programming like C/C++, as well as study mathematics in my free time.
I'm also exceptionally quick to learn new things, as well as to adapt to new environments and methodologies.
